The method includes depositing a dielectric layer on a semiconductor substrate,depositing a metal layer on the dielectric layer,and depositing a hard mask layer on the metal layer. The method further includes forming a gate opening by removing a portion of the hard mask layer and a portion of the metal layer. The method further includes depositing a spacer material layer on sidewalls of the gate opening and forming a channel, the channel including a TMC layer, at a bottom of the gate opening. The method further includes forming a gate structure on the channel and in the gate opening and removing the hard mask layer. ",

The thin metal layer is treated with a chalcogen material, e.g., sulfur(S), selenium (Se), or tellurium (Te), to form a transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) materialbased 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate a high mobility channel in the center of the 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate lightly doped drains (LDDs） under S/D regions.The chalcogen treatment can further generate a gradient distribution of the TMC material at the two ends of the 2D channel.The gradient distribution can realize a semiconductor-semimetal-metal work function (WF) transition from the 2D channel to the S/D regions.The transition can reduce SBH,i.e., SBH tuning,between the 2D channel and the S/D regions to result in low contact resistance.The diffusion of chalcogen atoms into the thin metal layer can also reduce the van der Waals gap between the top and bottom surfaces of the 2D channel,and further reduce the contact resistance.

The channel last process means the channel is formed after the S/D regions are formed.In some embodiments, a gate opening (e.g., gate opening 506 or 516) is formed through a metal layer, e.g.,Ti,W,or Mo, leaving a thin metal layer at the bottom of the gate opening. The thin metal layer is treated with a chalcogen material, e.g., S,Se,or Te,to form a 2D channel (e.g.,2D channel 108, 122,or 124).A TMC material can be formed in the 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate a high mobility channel in the center of the 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate LDDs under the S/D regions (e.g., S/D regions 106A-106B and 118A-118B). The chalcogen treatment can further generate a gradient distribution of the TMC material at the two ends of the 2D channel. The gradient distribution can realize a semiconductor-semimetal-metal WF transition from the 2D channel to the S/D regions. The transition can reduce SBH, i.e., SBH tuning, between the 2D channel and the S/D regions to result in low contact resistance.The diffusion of chalcogen atoms into the thin metal layer can also reduce the van der Waals gap between the top and bottom surfaces of the 2D channel,and further reduce the contact resistance.
