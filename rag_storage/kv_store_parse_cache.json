        "text": "[0015] Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an interconnect structure comprising a first capping layer over a first interconnect conductive structure and a second capping layer arranged over the first capping layer. In such embodiments,the first and second capping layers comprise different two-dimensional materials.The first capping layer is arranged directly on a topmost surface of the first interconnect conductive structure,and the second capping layer is arranged directly on the first capping layer. The first capping layer comprises a first two-dimensional material that reduces the electromigration and the resistivity of the first interconnect conductive structure.The second cappinglayer comprises a second two-dimensional material that has a better adhesion with other layers (e.g., etch stop layers, interconnect dielectric layers,barrier layers,liner layer, etc.) to be deposited over the first interconnect conductive structure than the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer. Thus,the second capping layer mitigates any adhesion issues that the first capping layer may have such that the first capping layer may still be used to reduce resistivity and electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure to increase the reliability of the interconnect structure without compromising the structural integrity of the interconnect structure.

In a sub-nanometer 2D channel,the contact area between the 2D channel and the S/D regions is very low. There is a high van der Waals gap between the top and bottom surfaces of the 2D channel.

The thin metal layer is treated with a chalcogen material, e.g., sulfur(S), selenium (Se), or tellurium (Te), to form a transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) materialbased 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate a high mobility channel in the center of the 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate lightly doped drains (LDDs） under S/D regions.The chalcogen treatment can further generate a gradient distribution of the TMC material at the two ends of the 2D channel.The gradient distribution can realize a semiconductor-semimetal-metal work function (WF) transition from the 2D channel to the S/D regions.The transition can reduce SBH,i.e., SBH tuning,between the 2D channel and the S/D regions to result in low contact resistance.The diffusion of chalcogen atoms into the thin metal layer can also reduce the van der Waals gap between the top and bottom surfaces of the 2D channel,and further reduce the contact resistance.
