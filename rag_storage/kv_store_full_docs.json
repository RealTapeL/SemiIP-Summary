No.17/097,406, filed on Nov.13,2020 (now U.S. Pat.No.11,532,549,issued on Dec.20,2022).The contents of the above-referenced patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n[0002]As dimensions and feature sizes of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) are scaled down, the density of the elements forming the ICs is increased and the spacing between elements is reduced.As the distance between any two adjacent conductive features decreases,the resulting capacitance increases,which will increase power consumption and time delay. Thus,manufacturing techniques and device design are being investigated to reduce IC size while maintaining or improving performance of the IC. \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\n[0003] Aspects of the present disclosure are best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying figures. It is noted that, in accordance with the standard practice in the industry,various features are not drawn to scale.In fact, the dimensions of the various features may be arbitrarily increased or reduced for clarity of discussion. \n\n[0004]FIG.1 illustrates a cross-sectional view of some embodiments of an integrated chip having a first capping layer and a second capping layer arranged over a topmost surface of a first interconnect conductive structure. \n\n[0005]FIGS.2A,2B,3,4,and 5 illustrate cross-sectional views of some other embodiments of an integrated chip having a first capping layer arranged directly on a topmost surface of a first interconnect conductive structure and a second capping layer arranged directly on the first capping layer. \n\n[0006]FIG.6 illustrates a cross-sectional view of some embodiment of an integrated chip having a first capping layer and a second capping layer arranged over a topmost surface of a first interconnect conductive structure,wherein the first interconnect conductive structure is coupled to a semiconductor device,and wherein a second interconnect conductive structure overlies and is electrically coupled to the first interconnect conductive structure. \n\n[0007]FIGS.7 and 8 illustrate cross-sectional views of some other embodiments of an integrated chip having first and second capping layers arranged over a topmost surface of a first interconnect conductive structure and having a second interconnect conductive structure arranged over and electrically coupled to the first interconnect conductive structure. \n\n[0008]FIGS.9-21 illustrate cross-sectional views of some embodiments of forming an integrated chip having a first capping layer and a second capping layer arranged over a topmost surface of a first interconnect conductive structure. [0009]FIG.22 illustrates a flow diagram of some embodiments of a method corresponding to FIGS.9-21. \n\n[0010]The following disclosure provides many different embodiments,or examples,for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure.These are,of course,merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.For example, the formation of a frst feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact,and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features,such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition,the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples.This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed. \n\n[0011]Further, spatially relative terms,such as“beneath,” “below,”“lower,”“above,”“upper”and the like,may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures.The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations） and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly. \n\n[0012] Integrated chips may include a number of semiconductor devices (e.g.,transistors,capacitors,inductors, etc.) and/or memory devices disposed over and/or within a semiconductor substrate.An interconnect structure may be disposed over the semiconductor substrate and coupled to the semiconductor devices. The interconnect structure may include interconnect conductive structures such as interconnect wires and interconnect vias within interconnect dielectric layers.The interconnect conductive structures provide electrical pathwaysbetween differentsemiconductor devices disposed within and/or over the semiconductor substrate. \n\n[0013]Some embodiments of an interconnect structure include a first interconnect conductive structure arranged within an interconnect dielectric layer. In some embodiments,as the width of the first interconnect conductive structure decreases,the resistivity of the first interconnect conductive structure increases,which reduces the reliability of the interconnect structure.Further, in some instances,as the width of the first interconnect conductive structure decreases,electromigration increases,which reduces the reliability of the interconnect structure. \n\n[0014]A first capping layer comprising，for example, graphene or some other first two-dimensional material, may be formed on a topmost surface of the first interconnect conductive structure to reduce resistivity and electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure. In some embodiments,the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer may be a material that has a planar,hexagonal structure,such as,for example,graphene,hexagonal boron nitride,molybdenum sulfide,tantalum sulfide,hafnium sulfide,tungsten selenide, borocarbonates， germanane, $\\mathrm { N i } _ { 3 }$ $\\mathrm { ( H I T P ) } _ { 2 }$ ,or some other suitable material with a two-dimensional crystal structure.However, in some embodiments, the first capping layer comprises a material that other layers to be deposited on the first capping layer, such as etch stop layers,interconnect dielectric layers,barrier layers,liner layers,or the like do not adhere well to.Thus, the structural integrity of the interconnect structure may be compromised when using certain materials as the first capping layer over the first interconnect conductive structure. \n\n[0015] Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an interconnect structure comprising a first capping layer over a first interconnect conductive structure and a second capping layer arranged over the first capping layer. In such embodiments,the first and second capping layers comprise different two-dimensional materials.The first capping layer is arranged directly on a topmost surface of the first interconnect conductive structure,and the second capping layer is arranged directly on the first capping layer. The first capping layer comprises a first two-dimensional material that reduces the electromigration and the resistivity of the first interconnect conductive structure.The second cappinglayer comprises a second two-dimensional material that has a better adhesion with other layers (e.g., etch stop layers, interconnect dielectric layers,barrier layers,liner layer, etc.) to be deposited over the first interconnect conductive structure than the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer. Thus,the second capping layer mitigates any adhesion issues that the first capping layer may have such that the first capping layer may still be used to reduce resistivity and electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure to increase the reliability of the interconnect structure without compromising the structural integrity of the interconnect structure. \n\n[0016] FIG.1 illustrates a cross-sectional view 100 of some embodiments of an integrated chip comprising an interconnect structure having a first and second capping layer over a first conductive structure. \n\n[0017]The integrated chip of FIG.1 includes an interconnect structure 104 arranged over a substrate 102.In some embodiments, the interconnect structure 104 comprises a lower interconnect via 106 and a first interconnect conductive structure 120 arranged over and coupled to the lower interconnect via 106.In some embodiments,the interconnect structure 104 further comprises a lower interconnect dielectric layer 1o8,wherein the lower interconnect via 106 is embedded in and extends through the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108,and comprises a first interconnect dielectric layer 112,wherein the first interconnect conductive structure 120 is embedded in and extends through the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some embodiments, a first etch stop layer 110 may be arranged between the lower and first interconnect dielectric layers 108,112.In some such embodiments,the first interconnect conductive structure 120 may extend through the first etch stop layer 110 to electrically contact the lower interconnect via 106. \n\n[0018]Further,in some embodiments,the interconnect structure 104 may be coupled to one or more semiconductor devices (e.g., transistors,inductors, capacitors,etc.） and/or memory devices (not shown) disposed over and/or within the substrate 102.Thus, the conductive features (e.g.,lower interconnect via 106,first interconnect conductive structure 120) of the interconnect structure 104 may be electrically coupled to one another and to any underlying or overlying devices (not shown） to provide a conductive pathway for signals (e.g.,voltage,current） traveling through the integrated chip. \n\n[0019] In some embodiments,more than one of the first interconnect conductive structures 120 are embedded within the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some embodiments,the first interconnect structure 120 has outermost sidewalls that contact a first barrier layer 116 and are surrounded bya first liner layer 118 that contacts the first barrier layer 116.In some embodiments,the first barrier layer 116 may comprise a material that mitigates diffusion of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 into the first interconnect dielectric layer 112,thereby reducing cross-talk in the interconnect structure 104.Further, in some embodiments,the first liner layer118 may be a seed layer to aid in the formation of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 on the first liner layer 118.In some other embodiments, the first liner layer 118 may be a glue layer,wherein the first interconnect conductive structure 120 adheres to the first liner layer 1l8 better than the first barrier layer 116.Further, in some embodiments, the first liner layer118 and/or the first barrier layer 116 cover a bottommost surface of the first interconnect conductive structure 120. \n\n[0020] In some embodiments,as a critical dimension of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 decreases, the resistivity of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 increases,thereby reducing the reliability of the interconnect structure 104.In some embodiments, the critical dimension is defined as a minimum dimension of the first interconnect conductive structure 120,such as,for example,a first distance ${ \\bf d } _ { 1 }$ in FIG.1.In some embodiments,the first distance ${ \\mathrm { d } } _ { 1 }$ does not include the first liner layer 118 and/or the first barrierlayer 116,whereas in other embodiments, the first distance ${ \\mathrm { d } } _ { 1 }$ includes the first liner layer 118 and/or the first barrier layer 116.In some embodiments,the first distance ${ \\mathrm { d } _ { 1 } }$ is in a range of between, for example, approximately 5 angstroms and approximately 500 angstroms. \n\n[0021]In some embodiments,a first capping layer 122 is arranged over a topmost surface 120t of the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 comprises a first two-dimensional material that reduces the resistivity of the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In some embodiments,the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 may comprise,for example,a material having a two-dimensional structure (e.g.,hexagonal crystal structure,planar crystal structure) such as, for example,graphene, intercalated graphene,nitrogen-doped graphene,oxygen-graphene,modified graphene,or some other type of graphene.In some other embodiments,the first capping layer 122 may comprise, for example,hexagonal boron nitride,molybdenum sulfide, tantalum sulfide,hafnium sulfide,tungsten selenide,borocarbonates,germanane, $\\mathrm { N i } _ { 3 } ( \\mathrm { H I T P } ) _ { 2 }$ ,or some other suitable material with a two-dimensional crystal structure.In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 may also reduce electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure 120.By improving the electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure 120,the first capping layer 122 allows the first interconnect conductive structure 120 to withstand high currents without changing shape and/or breaking down. \n\n[0022] In some embodiments,the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 may not have a dangling bond and does not adhere well to layers that are arranged over the first capping layer 122,such as,for example,a second etch stop layer 114.Thus,in some embodiments,a second capping layer 124 is arranged over the first capping layer 122.In some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 comprises a second two-dimensional material that is different than the first two-dimensional material,wherein overlying layers/features,such as the second etch stop layer 114,adhere to the second twodimensional material of the second capping layer 124 better than the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer122.In other words,in some embodiments, the second capping layer 124 acts as a glue layer between the first capping layer 122 and any overlying layers/features,such as, for example,the second etch stop layer 114.In some embodiments, the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 may comprise,for example, hexagonal boron nitride,molybdenum sulfide, tantalum sulfide,hafnium sulfide,tungsten selenide,borocarbonates, germanane, $\\mathrm { N i } _ { 3 } ( \\mathrm { H I T P } ) _ { 2 }$ ，or some other suitable material with a two-dimensional crystal structure. \n\n[0023]In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 is selectively deposited onto the first interconnect conductive structure 120 and is not formed on the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 is also selectively deposited onto the first liner layer 118 and/or the first barrier layer 16.In some embodiments,the selective deposition is based on the first twodimensional material of the first capping layer 122 being different than the first interconnect dielectric layer 112. Further, in some embodiments,the selective deposition is based on a pre-treatment technique to activate or deactivate certain layers such that the first capping layer 122 is selectively formed on the first interconnect conductive structure 120.It will be appreciated that other techniques of selective deposition are also within the scope of this disclosure.The selective deposition of the first capping layer 122 may increase the reliability of the interconnect structure 104 by avoiding deposition and subsequent removal of the first capping layer 122 on the first interconnect dielectric layer 112,thereby mitigating damage to the first interconnect dielectric layer 1l2 through removal processes (e.g., etching). \n\n[0024]Further, in some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 is also selectively deposited on the first capping layer 122. Thus, in some embodiments, the second capping layer124 directly contacts the first capping layer 122 and does not directly contact the first interconnect dielectric layer112.In some embodiments,the second etch stop layer 114 is arranged over the second capping layer 124 and the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 to protect the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 and/or the second capping layer 124 from future deposition processes (e.g., physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), sputtering, etc.), patterning processes (e.g., photolithography),and/or removal processes (e.g.,chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)).Because the second capping layer 124 is arranged over the first capping layer 122,potential adhesion issues between the first capping layer 122 and the second etch stop layer 114 may be mitigated.Thus,the first and second capping layers 122,124 reduce resistivity and electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 without compromising the structural integrity of the interconnect structure 104. [0025] FIG.2A illustrates a cross-sectional view 200A of some other embodiments of an integrated chip comprising an interconnect structure having a first and second capping layer over a first conductive structure. \n\n[0026]In some embodiments,the first barrier layer 116 may comprise,for example,tantalum,tantalum nitride, titanium,titanium nitride,tungsten nitride,or the like.In some embodiments,the first liner layer 118 may comprise, for example, copper,cobalt, ruthenium,or some other suitable material.In some other embodiments,the first liner layer118 may comprise tantalum, titanium,silicon nitride, or some other suitable material.In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 is selectively deposited on the topmost surface ${ \\bf 1 2 0 } t$ of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 and is not deposited on the first liner layer 118 and/or the first barrier layer 116. \n\n[0027]In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 may have a first width $\\mathbf { W } _ { 1 }$ in a range of between,for example,approximately 5 angstroms and approximately 500 angstroms.In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 has a first thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 1 }$ in a range of between, for example, approximately 3 angstroms and approximately 300 angstroms.In some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 is selectively deposited on the first capping layer 122. In such embodiments,the first width $\\mathbf { W } _ { 1 }$ of the first capping layer 122 may be about equal to a second width $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ of the second capping layer 124.In some embodiments,the second width $\\mathbf { W } _ { 2 }$ is in a range of between, for example,approximately 5 angstroms and approximately 5oo angstroms. Further, in some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 may have a second thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 2 }$ in a range of between, for example,approximately 3 angstroms and approximately 300 angstroms.In some embodiments,because the first and second capping layers 122,124 comprise two-dimensional materials,the first and second thicknesses $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 1 }$ $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 2 }$ of the first and second capping layers 122,124 may be substantially small (e.g.，about 3 angstroms)，which advantageously reduces the height of the overall interconnect structure 104. \n\n[0028] FIG.2B illustrates a cross-sectional view 200B of some alternative embodiments of the cross-sectional view 200A of FIG. 2A. \n\n[0029]In some embodiments,the topmost surface 120t of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 is arranged below a topmost surface 112t of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some such embodiments, the topmost surface 12Ot of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 may be arranged below the topmost surface 112t of the first interconnect dielectric layer 1i2 because during formation of the first interconnect conductive structure 120, portions of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 may be etched back below the topmost surface ${ \\bf 1 1 2 } t$ of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some other embodiments,the topmost surface ${ \\bf 1 2 0 } t$ of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 may be arranged below the topmost surface ${ \\bf 1 1 2 } t$ of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 because the first capping layer 122 reacts with first interconnect conductive structure 120 during the selective deposition of the first capping layer 122 on the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In some such embodiments,the first capping layer 122 may be arranged partially or completely below the topmost surface 12t of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112. \n\n[0030]FIG.3 illustrates a cross-sectional view 300 of some embodiments of an integrated chip comprising an interconnect structure having a frst and second capping layer over a first conductive structure,wherein the second capping layer is wider than the first capping layer. \n\n[0031]In some embodiments,while the first capping layer 122 is selectively deposited over the topmost surface ${ \\bf 1 2 0 } t$ of the first interconnect conductive structure 120, the second capping layer 124 is not selectively deposited.Instead, in some such embodiments, the second capping layer 124 is formed over the first capping layer 122 and the first interconnect dielectric layer112.In some embodiments,where there are more than one first interconnect conductive structures 120 within the first interconnect dielectric layer 112, the second capping layer 124 may continuously extend over and between the more than one first interconnect conductive structures 120. In such embodiments, the second capping layer 124 may be arranged laterally between one or more first capping layers 122.In such embodiments,the second capping layer 124 is arranged on and surrounds outer sidewalls of the frst capping layer 122. \n\n[0032]In some such embodiments,the second width $\\mathbf { W } _ { 2 }$ of the second capping layer 124 is larger than the first width $\\mathbf { W } _ { 1 }$ of the first capping layer 122.Further, in some embodiments, the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer124 is non-conductive,such that a first one of the first interconnect conductive structures 120 is not electrically coupled to a second one of the first interconnect conductive structures 120.In some embodiments, the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 may comprise a conductive or a non-conductive material.In some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 separates the second etch stop layer 114 from the first interconnect dielectric layer 112. \n\n[0033] FIG.4 illustrates a cross-sectional view 400 of some embodiments of an integrated chip comprising an interconnect structure having a first and second capping layer overa first conductive structure,wherein a protective layer laterally surrounds the first capping layer. \n\n[0034]In some embodiments,the interconnect structure 104 further comprises a protective layer 402 that laterally surrounds the first capping layer 122 and that is arranged directly between the second etch stop layer 114 and the first interconnect dielectric layer 1l2.In some embodiments, the protective layer 402 comprises,for example, a nitride (e.g., silicon nitride),an oxide (e.g., silicon dioxide,silicon oxynitride),or some other suitable dielectric material that has a dielectric constant in a range of between，for example, approximately 1.5 and approximately 3.9.In some embodiments,the protective layer 402 has a third thickness $\\mathrm { t } _ { 3 }$ ina range of between, for example,approximately 1 angstrom and approximately 50o angstroms.Thus,in some embodiments,the third thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 3 }$ of the protective layer 402 may be less than,equal to,or greater than the first thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 1 }$ of the first capping layer 122.In some embodiments, the protective layer 402 is selectively deposited onto the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 to protect the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 from damage from future processing steps,such as the selective deposition of the second capping layer 124.In some embodiments, the protective layer 402 is also selectively deposited over the first barrier layer116 and/or the first liner layer118. \n\n[0035]In some embodiments,the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 and the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108 may each comprise, for example,a nitride (e.g.,silicon nitride,silicon oxynitride),a carbide (e.g.,silicon carbide), an oxide (e.g.,silicon oxide)，borosilicate glass (BSG), phosphoric silicate glass (PSG),borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG),a low-k oxide (e.g.,a carbon doped oxide,SiCOH), or some other low-k dielectric material having a dielectric constant in a range of between,for example,approximately 1.5 and approximately 3.9.In some embodiments,the first etch stop layer 110 and the second etch stop layer 114 may each comprise,for example, silicon nitride,silicon carbide, or some other suitable etch stop material.In some embodiments,the first and/or second etch stop layers 110,114 may comprise multiple layers of various materials. \n\n[0036]FIG.5 illustrates a cross-sectional view 500 of some embodiments of an integrated chip comprising_an interconnect structure having a first and second capping layer over a first conductive structure,wherein the second capping layer is arranged directly on the first capping layer and a protective layer. \n\n[0037]In some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 is arranged over the protective layer 402 and the first capping layer 122. In such embodiments, the second capping layer124 may not be selectively deposited over the first capping layer 122.In some embodiments,the second twodimensional material of the second capping layer 124 is non-conductive.Further, in some embodiments,the third thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 3 }$ of the protective layer 402 may be less than the first thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 1 }$ of the first capping layer 122.In such embodiments,a bottommost surface of the second capping layer 124 may be below a topmost surface of the first capping layer 122. \n\n[0038]FIG.6 illustrates a cross-sectional view 600 of some embodiments of an integrated chip comprising an interconnect structure having a first and second capping layer over a first conductive structure,wherein a second interconnect conductive structure is arranged over and coupled to the first conductive structure,and wherein a semiconductor device is coupled to and arranged below the first interconnect conductive structure. \n\n[0039]In some embodiments,the lower interconnect via 106 is coupled to an underlying semiconductor device 602. In some embodiments, the underlying semiconductor device 602 may comprise,for example,a field effect transistor (FET).In such embodiments,the semiconductor device 602 may comprise source/drain regions 6o4 arranged on or within the substrate 102.The source/drain regions 604 may comprise doped portions of the substrate 102.Further, in some embodiments, the semiconductor device 602 may comprise a gate electrode 606 arranged over the substrate 102 and between the source/drain regions 604.In some embodiments,a gate dielectric layer 6o8 may be arranged directly between the gate electrode 606 and the substrate 102.In some embodiments,the lower interconnect via 106 is coupled to one of the source/drain regions 604,whereas in other embodiments,the lower interconnect via 106 may be coupled to the gate electrode 606 of the semiconductor device 602.Further in some embodiments, it will be appreciated that the interconnect structure 104 may couple the semiconductor device 602 to some other semiconductor device,memory device,photo device,or some other electronic device.It will be appreciated that other electronic/ semiconductor devices other than the FET illustrated as the semiconductor device 602 are also within the scope of this disclosure,such as,for example,gate all around FETs, finFETs,or the like. \n\n[0040]Further,in some embodiments,the interconnect structure 104 may comprise a second interconnect dielectric layer 61o.In some embodiments,a second interconnect conductive structure 612 and a third interconnect conductive structure 614 arranged over the second interconnect conductive structure 612 extend through and are embedded in the second interconnect dielectric layer 61o.In some embodiments,the second interconnect conductive structure 612 is an interconnect via,and the third interconnect conductive structure 614 is an interconnect wire.In some embodiments,the second and third interconnect conductive structures 612,614 are formed by way of a dual damascene process. \n\n[0041] In some embodiments,the second interconnect conductive structure 612 extends through the second etch stop layer 14 to electrically contact the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In some embodiments,a bottommost surface $\\mathbf { 6 1 2 } b$ of the second interconnect conductive structure 612 directly contacts a topmost surface 124t of the second capping layer 124.In some such embodiments,the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 and the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 may comprise conductive materials.Thus, in some such embodiments,although the second interconnect conductive structure 612 does not directly contact the first interconnect conductive structure 120, the second interconnect conductive structure 612 is electrically coupled to the first interconnect conductive structure 12o through the first and second capping layers 122,124 comprising conductive materials. \n\n[0042] FIG.7 illustrates a cross-sectional view 700 of some other embodiments of an integrated chip comprising an interconnect structure having a first and second capping layer over a first conductive structure,wherein a second interconnect conductive structure is arranged over and extends through the second capping layer to contact the first capping layer. \n\n[0043] In some embodiments,the second interconnect conductive structure 612 extends through the second capping layer 124 such that the bottommost surface $\\mathbf { 6 1 2 } b$ of the second interconnect conductive structure 612 directly contacts a topmost surface ${ \\bf 1 } 2 2 t$ of the first capping layer 122. In some such embodiments,the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 may be nonconductive.In some other embodiments,the second twodimensional material of the second capping layer 124 may be conductive.Further, in some such embodiments,the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 may be conductive such that even though the second interconnect conductive structure 612 does not directly contact the first interconnect conductive structure 120,the first and second interconnect conductive structures 612,120 are still electrically contacting one another. \n\n[0044]Further,in some embodiments,the first interconnect conductive structure 120 may be continuously connected to the lower interconnect via 106.In some such embodiments,the first liner layer1i8 and the first barrier layer 116 may also surround outermost sidewalls of the lower interconnect via 106.In some such embodiments, the first interconnect conductive structure 120 and the lower interconnect via 106 may have been formed through a dual damascene process.In some embodiments,the lower interconnect via 1o6, the first interconnect conductive structure 120, the second interconnect conductive structure 612,and the third interconnect conductive structure 614 may each comprise, for example, tungsten, copper, titanium,aluminum, tantalum,or some other suitable conductive material. \n\n[0045] FIG.8 illustrates a cross-sectional view 800 of some other embodiments of an integrated chip comprising an interconnect structure having a first and second capping layer over a first conductive structure,wherein a second interconnect conductive structure is arranged over and extends through the first capping layer and the second capping layer to contact the first interconnect conductive structure. \n\n[0046]In some embodiments,the second interconnect conductive structure 612 extends through the second capping layer 124 and the first capping layer 122 such that the bottommost surface $\\mathbf { 6 1 2 } b$ of the second interconnect conductive structure 612 directly contacts a topmost surface 120t of the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In some such embodiments,the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 and the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 may be non-conductive.In some other embodiments,even if the first and/or second capping layers 122,124 comprise a conductive material, the second interconnect conductive structure 612 may still extend through the first and second capping layers 122,124 to directly contact the first interconnect conductive structure 120. \n\n[0047]Because the topmost surface 120t of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 is covered by the first and second capping layers 122,124 as well as, in some embodiments,the second interconnect conductive structure 612, electromigration and resistivity of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 are reduced, thereby increasing the reliability of the interconnect structure 104. \n\n[0048] FIGS.9-21 illustrate cross-sectional views 900- 2100 of some embodiments of a method of forming an integrated chip having a first capping layer and a second capping layer arranged over a topmost surface of a first interconnect conductive structure to reduce resistivity and electromigration without sacrificing the structural integrity of the overall integrated chip.Although FIGS.9-21 are described in relation to a method, it will be appreciated that the structures disclosed in FIGS.9-21 are not limited to such a method,but instead may stand alone as structures independent of the method. \n\n[0049]As shown in cross-sectional view 9o0 of FIG.9,a substrate 102 is provided.In some embodiments, the substrate 102 may be or comprise any type of semiconductor body (e.g., silicon/CMOS bulk, SiGe, SOI,etc.) such as a semiconductor wafer or one or more die on a wafer,as well as any other type of semiconductor and/or epitaxial layers formed thereon and/or associated with. In some embodiments,a lower interconnect dielectric layer 1o8 is formed over the substrate 102.In some embodiments,various semiconductor devices (e.g., transistors,inductors,capacitors,etc.） and/or memory devices (not shown） may be arranged over and/or within the substrate 102 and beneath the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108.In some embodiments,a lower interconnect via 106 may be formed within the lower interconnect dielectric layer io8 and coupled to the one or more of the various semiconductor devices and/or memory devices (not shown). \n\n[0050] In some embodiments，the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108 may be formed by way of a deposition process (e.g.， spin-on, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD),atomic layer deposition (ALD),etc.). In some embodiments, the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108 may comprise, for example,a low-k dielectric material (e.g.,dielectric constant in a range of between about 1.5 and about 3.9) such as a nitride (e.g., silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride),a carbide (e.g., silicon carbide),an oxide (e.g., silicon oxide), borosilicate glass (BSG), phosphoric silicate glass (PSG), borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG),a low-k oxide (e.g.,a carbon doped oxide, SiCOH),or some other suitable low-k dielectric material. \n\n[0051]In some embodiments, the lower interconnect via 106 may be formed within the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108 through various steps of patterning (e.g.， photolithography/etching), deposition (e.g.,PVD, CVD, plasmaenhanced CVD (PE-CVD)，ALD，sputtering，etc.)，and removal (e.g., wet etching,dry etching,chemical mechanical planarization (CMP),etc.) processes.In some embodiments，the lower interconnect via 106 may comprise a conductive material such as, for example, tantalum, tantalum nitride,titanium nitride,copper, cobalt,ruthenium, molybdenum,iridium,tungsten,or some other suitable conductive material. \n\n[0052]In some embodiments,a first etch stop layer110 is formed over the lower interconnect via 1o6 and over the lower interconnect dielectric layer 1o8.In some embodiments,the first etch stop layer 110 is formed by way of a deposition process (e.g.,PVD, CVD,ALD, spin-on, etc.). In some embodiments,the first etch stop layer 110 may comprise,for example,silicon carbide,silicon dioxide,silicon oxygen carbide,silicon nitride,silicon carbon nitride,silicon oxynitride,silicon oxygen carbon nitride,aluminum oxygen nitride,aluminum oxide,or some other suitable material.In some embodiments,the first etch stop layer 110 comprises a different material than the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108. \n\n[0053]In some embodiments,a first interconnect dielectric layer 112 is formed by way of a deposition process (e.g., spin-on, PVD, CVD,ALD,etc.). In some embodiments, the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 may comprise,for example,a low-k dielectric material (e.g., dielectric constant in a range of between about 1.5 and about 3.9) such as a nitride (e.g., silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride),a carbide (e.g., silicon carbide),an oxide (e.g., silicon oxide), borosilicate glass (BSG),phosphoric silicate glass (PSG), borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG),a low-k oxide (e.g.,a carbon doped oxide,SiCOH),or some other suitable low-k dielectric material.In some embodiments,the first interconnect dielectric layer112 comprises a same material as the lower interconnect dielectric layer 1o8,whereas in other embodiments,the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 comprises a different material than the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108.Further, the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 comprises a different material than the first etch stop layer 110. [0054] As shown in cross-sectional view 1000 of FIG.10, in some embodiments,a removal process is performed to form openings 10o2 in the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some embodiments,the removal process of FIG.10 includes various steps of various steps of photolithography and removal (e.g., wet etching, dry etching, etc.) processes. In some embodiments, the openings 10o2 have a width equal to a first distance ${ \\mathrm { d } _ { 1 } }$ .In some embodiments,the first distance ${ \\mathrm { d } } _ { 1 }$ is in a range of between, for example,approximately 5 angstroms and approximately 5oo angstroms.In some embodiments, the removal process of FIG.10 also removes portions of the first etch stop layer 110 to expose the lower interconnect via 106.In some embodiments,two different etchants are used in the removal process of FIG.10,wherein a first etchant removes portions of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112,and wherein a second etchant removes portions of the first etch stop layer 110.In such embodiments, the lower interconnect dielectric layer 108 is substantially resistant to the second etchant that removes the first etch stop layer 110. \n\n[0055]As shown in cross-sectional view 1100 of FIG.11, in some embodiments,a first continuous barrier layer 1102 is formed within the openings (1002 of FIG.10) of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 and the first etch stop layer 110.In some embodiments,the first continuous barrier layer 1102 is formed by way of a deposition process (e.g., PVD, CVD,ALD,sputtering, etc.). In some embodiments, the first continuous barrier layer 1102 comprises,for example, tantalum, tantalum nitride,titanium, titanium nitride,tungsten nitride,or the like.Further,in some embodiments,a first continuous liner layer 11o4 is formed over the first continuous barrier layer 11o2.In some embodiments,the frst continuous liner layer 11o4 is formed over the first continuous barrier layer 11o2.In some embodiments,the first continuous liner layer 1104 comprises,for example, copper, cobalt,ruthenium,tantalum,titanium,silicon nitride,or some other suitable material. \n\n[0056]Further,in some embodiments,a first conductive material 11o6 is formed over the first continuous liner layer 1104 to completely fll the openings (1002 of FIG.10).In some embodiments,the first conductive material 1106 is formed by way of a deposition process (e.g.,PVD, CVD, ALD,sputtering，etc.).In some embodiments,the first conductive material 11o6 comprises,for example,tantalum, tantalum nitride,titanium nitride, copper,cobalt, aluminum, ruthenium,molybdenum,iridium, tungsten,or some other suitable conductive material. \n\n[0057] As shown in cross-sectional view 1200 of FIG.12, in some embodiments,a planarization process (e.g.,chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)）isperformed to remove portions of the first continuous barrier layer (1102 of FIG.11), the first continuous liner layer (1104 of FIG.11), and the first conductive material (1106 of FIG.11) arranged over the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.Thus,after the planarization process of FIG.12,a first interconnect conductive structure 120 extends through the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 and is electrically coupled to the lower interconnect via 106.Further, in some embodiments,a first liner layer 118 is arranged on outer sidewalls and/or a bottom surface of the first interconnect conductive structure 120,and a first barrier layer 116 is arranged on outer sidewalls and/or a bottom surface of the first liner layer 118. In some embodiments,the first barrier layer 116 mitigates diffusion of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 to reduce cross-talk,and in some embodiments,the first liner layer 118 is a seed layer for formation of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 or a glue layer between the first interconnect conductive structure 12o and the first barrier layer16.In some embodiments,a width of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 is about equal to the first distance ${ \\mathrm { d } } _ { 1 }$ . In some other embodiments,an etching process may be used to remove portions of the first continuous barrier layer (1102 of FIG.11),the first continuous liner layer (1104 of FIG.11),and the frst conductive material (1106 of FIG.11) arranged over the first interconnect dielectric layer 112. \n\n[0058]As shown in cross-sectional view 1300A of FIG. 13A,a first capping layer 122 is selectively formed over the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 is formed by a deposition process (e.g.，CVD，plasma-enhanced CVD (PE-CVD), ALD,etc.),an exfoliation and transfer process,a thermal formation process, or some other suitable process.Further, the first capping layer 122 is selectively formed on the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In other words,in some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 is formed directly on the first interconnect conductive structure 120 and is not formed on the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some embodiments,the selective formation or selective deposition is based on a pre-treatment technique to activate or deactivate certain layers such that the first capping layer 122 is selectively formed on the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 may contact the first liner layer 118 and/or the first barrier layer 116,depending on the selective deposition pre-treatment technique.It will be appreciated that other techniques of selective deposition are also within the scope of this disclosure.In some embodiments,by using selective deposition to form the first capping layer 122, waste of the first two-dimensional material and damage to the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 are mitigated. \n\n[0059]In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 comprises a first two-dimensional material. The first twodimensional material of the first capping layer 122 comprises a material that mitigates resistivity and electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 to increase the reliability of the integrated chip.The first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 may have a planar, hexagonal structure,such as,for example, graphene, hexagonal boron nitride,molybdenum sulfide, tantalum sulfide,hafnium sulfide,tungsten selenide,borocarbonates, germanane, $\\mathrm { N i } _ { 3 } ( \\mathrm { H I T P } ) _ { 2 }$ ,or some other suitable material with a two-dimensional crystal structure.In some embodiments,if the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 comprises graphene,the first twodimensional material of the first capping layer 122 may be intercalated graphene,nitrogen doped graphene,oxygen doped graphene,or modified graphene.In some embodiments,the intercalated material of intercalated graphene may be,for example,a metal ion (e.g., lithium,potassium, cesium, sodium,etc.),organic compounds (e.g.,benzene, pyridine, furan, catechol, etc.), inorganic compounds (e.g., $\\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 3 }$ ， $\\mathbf { M o C l } _ { 5 }$ ， $\\mathrm { A u C l } _ { 3 }$ ， $\\mathrm { C u C l } _ { 2 }$ ， $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ ， $\\mathrm { A l C l } _ { 3 }$ ， $\\mathrm { B r } _ { 2 }$ $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ ${ \\mathrm { H N O } } _ { 3 }$ ， etc.)，polymers/oligomer (e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate),polystyrene,nylon 6,etc.),a combination thereof, or the like.It will be appreciated that other materials of the first two-dimensional material are also within the scope of the disclosure.For example,in some embodiments,the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122 may be further modified from the above exemplary materials by way of plasma treatments and/or precursor adjustments. \n\n[0060]In some embodiments,for example when the first capping layer 122 comprises graphene, the first capping layer 122 is formed in a chamber using a carbon-hydrogen precursor (e.g., $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 4 }$ $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ , etc.), set to a temperature in a range of between, for example,approximately 273 Kelvin and approximately 773 Kelvin, and set to a pressure in a range of between, for example $1 0 ^ { - 1 0 }$ Torr to approximately $1 0 ^ { - 9 }$ Torr. It will be appreciated that other processing conditions for graphene are also within the scope of this disclosure. \n\n[0061]In some embodiments,the frst capping layer 122 has a first thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 1 }$ in a range of between, for example, approximately 3 angstroms and approximately 300 angstroms.In some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 has a first width w in a range of between,for example, approximately 5 angstroms and approximately 50o angstroms.In some embodiments,the first thickness $\\mathrm { t } _ { 1 }$ of the first capping layer 122 is so small (e.g.,about 3 angstroms) at least in part because the first capping layer 122 comprises the first two-dimensional material. Thus,the first capping layer 122 does not add a significant height to the integrated chip. \n\n[0062]FIG.13B illustrates a cross-sectional view 1300B some alternative embodiments of FIG.13A after the formation of the first capping layer 122 on the first interconnect conductive structure 120. \n\n[0063] As shown in the cross-sectional view 1300B of FIG.13B,in some embodiments,the first capping layer 122 reacts with the first interconnect conductive structure 120 during the selective formation of the first capping layer 122. Thus,in some embodiments,a bottommost surface 122b of the first capping layer 122 is arranged below a topmost surface 112t of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some other embodiments,the bottommost surface $\\pmb { 1 2 2 b }$ of the first capping layer 122 is arranged below the topmost surface 1l2t of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 because an etching process is used in FIG.12 to form the first interconnect conductive structure 120.In some such embodiments,when an etching process is used to form the first interconnect conductive structure 120,the first interconnect conductive structure 120 may be etched below the topmost surface 1l2t of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.As a result,in such other embodiments,the bottommost surface ${ \\bf 1 2 2 } b$ of the first capping layer 122 is arranged below the topmost surface ${ \\bf 1 1 2 } t$ of the first interconnect dielectric layer 112. \n\n[0064] As shown in cross-sectional view 1400A of FIG. 14A,a second capping layer 124 is selectively formed over the first capping layer 122.In some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 comprises a second two-dimensional material that is different than the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122.In some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 may be formed by a selective deposition process such that the second capping layer 124 directly contacts the first capping layer 122 but does not contact the first interconnect dielectric layer 1l2.In some embodiments, the second capping layer 124 is formed by a deposition process (e.g.,CVD, plasmaenhanced CVD (PE-CVD),ALD, etc.), an exfoliation and transfer process,a thermal formation process,or some other suitable process. \n\n[0065]In some embodiments,the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 may have a planar, hexagonal structure,such as,for example,graphene,hexagonal boron nitride,molybdenum sulfide,tantalum sulfide, hafnium sulfide,tungsten selenide,borocarbonates，germanane, $\\mathrm { N i } _ { 3 } ( \\mathrm { H I T P } ) _ { 2 }$ ,or some other suitable material with a two-dimensional crystal structure.In some embodiments, the second capping layer 124 comprises an organic material, an inorganic material,a two-dimensional material, and or a mixture of the aforementioned materials.In some embodiments, if the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 comprises graphene,the second twodimensional material of the second capping layer 124 may be,for example,intercalated graphene, nitrogen doped graphene,oxygen doped graphene,or modified graphene.In some embodiments,the intercalated material of intercalated graphene may be,for example,a metal ion (e.g., lithium, potassium, cesium, sodium, etc.), organic compounds (e.g., benzene,pyridine, furan，catechol,etc.),inorganic compounds (e.g., $\\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 3 }$ $\\mathbf { M o C l } _ { 5 }$ $\\mathrm { A u C l } _ { 3 }$ $\\mathrm { C u C l } _ { 2 }$ $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ $\\mathrm { A l C l } _ { 3 }$ $\\mathrm { B r } _ { 2 }$ $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ $\\mathrm { H N O } _ { 3 }$ , etc.), polymers/oligomer (e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate)，polystyrene,nylon 6,etc.),a combination thereof, or the like.It will be appreciated that other materials of the second two-dimensional material are also within the scope of the disclosure.For example,in some embodiments, the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 may be further modified from the above exemplary materials by way of plasma treatments and/or precursor adjustments. \n\n[0066]In some embodiments,for example when the second capping layer 124 comprises graphene, the first capping layer 122 is formed in a chamber usinga carbon-hydrogen precursor (e.g., $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 4 }$ $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ , etc.),set to a temperature in a range of between, for example,approximately 273 Kelvin and approximately 773 Kelvin,and set to a pressure in a range of between, for example $1 0 ^ { - 1 0 }$ Torr to approximately $1 0 ^ { - 9 }$ Torr. It will be appreciated that other processing conditions for graphene are also within the scope of this disclosure. \n\n[0067] In some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 has a second thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 2 }$ in a range of between, for example,approximately 3 angstroms and approximately 300 angstroms.In some embodiments, the second capping layer 124 has a second width $\\mathbf { W } _ { 2 }$ in a range of between, for example,approximately 5 angstroms and approximately 500 angstroms.In some embodiments,the second thickness $\\mathfrak { t } _ { 2 }$ of the second capping layer 124 is so small (e.g.,about 3 angstroms) at least in part because the second capping layer 124 comprises the second two-dimensional material. Thus, the second capping layer 124 does not add a significant height to the integrated chip. \n\n[0068] As shown in cross-sectional view 1400B of FIG. 14B,in some embodiments,a second etch stop layer 114 is formed over the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 and the second capping layer 124.In some embodiments, the second etch stop layer 114 may comprise,for example, silicon carbide, silicon dioxide,silicon oxygen carbide, silicon nitride,silicon carbon nitride,silicon oxynitride, silicon oxygen carbon nitride,aluminum oxygen nitride, aluminum oxide,or some other suitable material.In some embodiments,the second etch stop layer 114 comprises a different material than the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some embodiments, the second etch stop layer i14 is formed by way of a deposition process (e.g., PVD, CVD, ALD,spin-on,etc.).In some embodiments,a removal process, such as a planarization process (e.g., CMP) may be performed after the deposition process such that the second etch stop layer114 has a substantially planar upper surface. In some embodiments,the second etch stop layer 114 completely covers the second capping layer 124. \n\n[0069]In some embodiments,the second etch stop layer 114 adheres better to the second capping layer 124 than the second etch stop layer 114 would have adhered to the first capping layer 122 if the second capping layer 124 were omitted. Thus, in some embodiments, the second capping layer 124 and the second etch stop layer 114 comprise materials that adhere well to one another.Further, in some embodiments, the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 also adheres well to the first two-dimensional material of the first capping layer 122. Thus,in some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 acts as a glue layer between the first capping layer 122 and the second etch stop layer 114. \n\n[0070]FIGS.15A and 15B illustrate some other embodiments of forming the second capping layer 124 and the second etch stop layer 114 over the first capping layer 122. Thus,in some other embodiments, the method may proceed from FIG.13A or 13B to FIG.15A, thereby foregoing the steps illustrated in FIGS.14A and 14B. \n\n[0071] As shown in cross-sectional view 1500A of FIG. 15A,the second capping layer 124 is formed over the first capping layer 122,the first liner layer 118,the first barrier layer 116,and the frst interconnect dielectric layer 112. Thus,in some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 isa continuous layer that completely covers the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In such embodiments,the second capping layer 124 is wider than the first capping layer 122.In such embodiments,the second capping layer 124 is not selectively deposited over just the first capping layer 122. In some such embodiments,the second capping layer 124 laterally surrounds the first capping layer 122.In some embodiments,wherein more than one first interconnect conductive structure 120 is arranged in the first interconnect dielectric layer 112, the second capping layer 124 may continuously extend over and between more than one of the first capping layers 122.In other words,in some embodiments, the second capping layer 124 extends over a first one of the first capping layers ${ \\bf 1 2 2 a }$ and a second one of the first capping layers $\\mathbf { 1 } 2 2 c$ ,and the first one of the first capping layers ${ \\bf 1 2 2 a }$ is spaced apart from the second one of the first capping layers $1 2 2 c$ by the second capping layer 124. \n\n[0072]In some such embodiments, the second capping layer 124 comprises the second two-dimensional material, and the second two-dimensional material is not conductive. Thus,the second capping layer 124 does not interfere with the electrical isolation between more than one of the first interconnect conductive structures 120 embedded in the first interconnect dielectric layer 112. \n\n[0073] As shown in cross-sectional view 150oB of FIG. 15B,the second etch stop layer 114 is formed over the second capping layer 124. \n\n[0074]FIGS.16A,16B,and 16C illustrate yet some other embodiments of forming the second capping layer 124 and the second etch stop layer 114 over the first capping layer 122.Thus,in yet some other embodiments,the method may proceed from FIG.13A or 13B to FIG.16A，thereby foregoing the steps illustrated in FIGS.14A,14B,15A,and 15B. \n\n[0075] As shown in cross-sectional view 1600A of FIG. 16A, prior to forming a second capping layer (e.g., 124 of FIG.16B) over the first capping layer 122,a protective layer 402 is selectively formed over the first interconnect dielectric layer 112.In some embodiments, the protective layer 402 is also selectively formed over the first liner layer 118 and the first barrier layer 116.In some embodiments,the selective formation of the protective layer 402 may be achieved using the same or similar methods as previously described in FIG.13A for the selective formation of the first capping layer 122.For example,in some embodiments, the protective layer 402 may be selectively formed over the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 by way of ALD,CVD, thermal formation processes,spin-coating,or the like. \n\n[0076]In some embodiments,the protective layer 402 may comprise,for example,a nitride (e.g.,silicon nitride), an oxide (e.g., silicon dioxide,silicon oxynitride),or some other suitable dielectric material that has a dielectric constant in a range of between, for example,approximately 1.5 and approximately 3.9.In some embodiments,the protective layer 402 hasa third thickness $\\mathrm { t } _ { 3 }$ in a range of between, for example,approximately 1 angstrom and approximately 500 angstroms.Thus,in some embodiments, the third thickness $\\mathrm { t } _ { 3 }$ of the protective layer 402 may be less than, equal to, or greater than the first thickness $\\mathrm { t } _ { 1 }$ of the first capping layer 122.In some embodiments,the protective layer 402 is selectively formed over the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 to protect the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 from damage from future processing steps,such as the selective deposition of the second capping layer 124 to be described in FIG. 16B. \n\n[0077] As shown in cross-sectional view 160oB of FIG. 16B, in some embodiments,the second capping layer 124 is then selectively formed over the first capping layer 122 and not the protective layer 402.In some embodiments,if the protective layer 402 is thicker than the first capping layer 122,the protective layer 402 may laterally surround outer sidewalls of the second capping layer 124. \n\n[0078] As shown in cross-sectional view 1600C of FIG. 16C,the second etch stop layer 114 is formed over the second capping layer 124 and the protective layer 402. \n\n[0079]FIGS.17A,17B,and 17C illustrate yet some other embodiments of forming the second capping layer 124 and the second etch stop layer 114 over the first capping layer 122.Thus, in yet some other embodiments,the method may proceed from FIG.13A or13B to FIG.17A,thereby foregoing the steps illustrated in FIGS.14A,14B,15A,15B, 16A,16B,and 16C. \n\n[0080] As shown in cross-sectional view 17o0A of FIG. 17A,in some embodiments,the protective layer 402 is selectively formed over the first interconnect dielectric layer 112 as described in FIG.16A. \n\n[0081] As shown in cross-sectional view 170oB of FIG. 17B,the second capping layer 124 is formed over the protective layer 402 and the first capping layer 122.In some such embodiments,the second capping layer 124 is a continuous layer formed over the first capping layer 122 and the protective layer 402.Thus,in some such embodiments, the second capping layer 124 is not selectively formed over just the first capping layer 122.In some such embodiments, to maintain isolation of the first interconnect conductive structure(s) 120 embedded in the first interconnect dielectric layer112,the second two-dimensional material of the second capping layer 124 is not conductive. \n\n[0082] As shown in cross-sectional view 1700C of FIG. 17C,the second etch stop layer 114 is formed over the second capping layer 124 and the protective layer 402. \n\n[0083] After the formation of the second etch stop layer 114,in some embodiments,the method may then proceed from FIG.14B to FIG.18, from FIG.15B to FIG.18,from FIG.16C to FIG.18,or from FIG.17C to FIG.18.The cross-sectional view 1800 of FIG.18 illustrates embodiments wherein the method proceeds from FIG.17C to FIG. 18.It will be appreciated that the steps in the method of FIGS.18-21 may be applied to the embodiments illustrated in FIGS.14B,15B,and 16C,as well. \n\n[0084]As shown in the cross-sectional view 1800 of FIG. 18,in some embodiments,a first upper interconnect dielectric layer 1802 is formed over the second etch stop layer 114; a third etch stop layer 1804 is formed over the first upper interconnect dielectric layer 18o2；and a second upper interconnect dielectric layer 1806 is formed over the third etch stop layer 1804. In some embodiments,the first upper interconnect dielectric layer 1802,the third etch stop layer 1804,and the second upper interconnect dielectric layer 1806 may each be formed by way of a deposition process (e.g.,PVD, CVD,ALD, etc.). In some embodiments,the first and second upper interconnect dielectric layers 1802, 1806 may comprise,for example,a nitride (e.g.,silicon nitride,silicon oxynitride),a carbide (e.g., silicon carbide), an oxide (e.g.， silicon oxide)，borosilicate glass (BSG), phosphoric silicate glass (PSG), borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG),a low-k oxide (e.g.,a carbon doped oxide, SiCOH), or some other low-k dielectric material having a dielectric constant in a range of between,for example,approximately 1.5and approximately 3.9.In some embodiments,the third etch stop layer 1804 may each comprise,for example, silicon nitride,silicon carbide,or some other suitable etch stop material.In some other embodiments, the third etch stop layer 18o4 and/or the second upper interconnect dielectric layer 1806 may be omitted. \n\n[0085]As shown in cross-sectional view 19o0 of FIG.19, in some embodiments,a removal process is performed to form openings 1902 in the second upper interconnect dielectric layer1806,the third etch stop layer 1804,the first upper interconnect dielectric layer 1802,and the second etch stop layer 114.In some embodiments,the openings 1902 also extend through the second capping layer 124 to expose the first capping layer 122.In some other embodiments,the openings 1902 may also extend through the first capping layer 122 to expose the first interconnect conductive structure 120.For example,in some embodiments,wherein the first and second capping layers 122,124 are not conductive, the openings 1902 may extend through the first and second capping layers 122,124.In some embodiments, the removal process ofFIG.19 includes various steps of various steps of photolithography and removal (e.g.,wet etching, dry etching,etc.) processes.In some embodiments,multiple etchants are used to remove portions of the different materials of in the second upper interconnect dielectric layer 1806,the third etch stop layer 18o4,the first upper interconnect dielectric layer1802,the second etch stop layer 114 and/or the second capping layer 124. \n\n[0086]It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the openings 1902 have varying widths by using multiple photolithography and removal processes as a part of a dual damascene process to simultaneously form an interconnect wire and an interconnect via within a dielectric structure (e.g., in the second upper interconnect dielectric layer 1806, the third etch stop layer 1804,and the first upper interconnect dielectric layer 1802). \n\n[0087]As shown in cross-sectional view 20o0 of FIG.20, a second continuous barrier layer 2oo2,a second continuous liner layer 2o04,and a second conductive material 2006 are formed within the openings (1902 of FIG.19). In some embodiments,the second continuous barrier layer 2oo2, the second continuous liner layer 2oo4,and the second conductive material 2oo6 may comprise a same or similar material as the first continuous barrier layer (1102 of FIG.11),the first continuous liner layer (1104 of FIG.11),and the first conductive material (1106 of FIG.11), respectively.Further, in some embodiments,the second continuous barrier layer 2002,the second continuous liner layer 2oo4,and the second conductive material 2oo6 may be formed through a same or similar deposition process as the first continuous barrier layer (1102 ofFIG.11),the first continuous liner layer (1104 of FIG.11),and the first conductive material (1106 of FIG. 11), respectively. \n\n[0088] As shown in cross-sectional view 2100 of FIG.21, a planarization process (e.g., chemical mechanical planarization (CMP))is performed to remove portions of the second continuous barrier layer (2002 of FIG.20)，the second continuous liner layer (2004 of FIG.20),and the second conductive material (2006 of FIG.20) arranged over the second upper interconnect dielectric layer 18o6.Thus, after the planarization process of FIG.21,a second interconnect conductive structure 612 and a third interconnect conductive structure 614 extend through the second upper interconnect dielectric layer 1806,the third etch stop layer 1804,the first upper interconnect dielectric layer 1802, the second etch stop layer 114,and the second capping layer 124 and are electrically coupled to the first interconnect conductive structure 120.Further, in some embodiments,a second liner layer 21o4 is arranged on outer sidewalls and/or a bottom surface of the second and third interconnect conductive structures 612,614,and a second barrier layer 2102 is arranged on outer sidewalls and/or a bottom surface of the second liner layer 2104. \n\n[0089]In some embodiments, the lower interconnect via 106, the interconnect conductive structures (e.g.,120, 612, 614),the dielectric layers (e.g.,108,112,402,1802,1806), the etch stop layers (e.g.,110,114,1804),the barrier and liner layers (e.g.,116,118,2102, 2104),and the capping layers (122,124) form an interconnect structure 104 over the substrate 102 that provides conductive pathways between various electronic devices (e.g.， semiconductor devices, photo devices,memory devices,etc.） arranged above and below the interconnect structure 104. \n\n[0090]At least because of the first and second capping layers 122,124,resistivity and electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure 120 are reduced without causing any adhesion issues in the interconnect structure 104.It will be appreciated that the first and second capping layers 122,124 may also be formed on other conductive structures (e.g.,106,612,614) of the interconnect structure 104 to further increase the resistivity and electromigration of the interconnect structure 104, thereby increasing the reliability of the interconnect structure 104. Thus, signals (e.g., current voltage) may be more reliably transported between various electronic devices (e.g.， semiconductor devices, photo devices,memory devices,etc.） arranged above and below the interconnect structure 104. \n\n[0091]FIG.22 illustrates a flow diagram of some embodiments of a method 2200 corresponding to the method illustrated in FIGS.9-21. \n\n[0092]While method 2200 is illustrated and described belowas a series of acts or events,it will be appreciated that the illustrated ordering of such acts or events are not to be interpreted in a limiting sense.For example, some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events apart from those illustrated and/or described herein.In addition, not allillustrated acts may be required to implement one or more aspects or embodiments of the description herein.Further, one or more of the acts depicted herein may be carried out in one or more separate acts and/or phases. \n\n[0093]At act 2202,a first interconnect dielectric layer is formed over a substrate.FIG.9 illustrates a cross-sectional view 90o of some embodiments corresponding to act 2202.

FIG.18 illustrates a cross-sectional view 180o of some embodiments corresponding to act 2212. \n\n[0099] At act 2214,a second interconnect conductive structure is formed within and extending through the second interconnect dielectric layer and the etch stop layer to contact the first interconnect conductive structure.FIG.21 illustrates a cross-sectional view 21o0 of some embodiments corresponding to act 2214. \n\n[0100]Therefore,the present disclosure relates toa method of selectively forming a frst capping layer over a first interconnect conductive structure in an interconnect structure to reduce resistivity and electromigration of the first interconnect conductive structure and forming a second capping layer over the first capping layer to reduce adhesion issues that may result without the second capping layer between the first capping layer and other overlying layers in the interconnect structure. \n\n[0101]Accordingly,in some embodiments,the present disclosure relates to an integrated chip comprising:a first interconnect dielectric layer arranged over a substrate;

[0007]FIG.2 is a flow diagram ofa method for fabricating a 2D channel FET,in accordance with some embodiments. [0008]FIGS.3A-3B,4A-4B，5A-5C,6A-6C，7A-7D, 8A-8C,9A-9C,10A-10C,11A-11C,and 12A-12C illustrate cross-sectional views of a 2D channel FET at various stages of its fabrication process,in accordance with some embodiments. \n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION \n\n[0009]The following disclosure provides many different embodiments,or examples,for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure.These are,of course,merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.For example, the process for forming a first feature overa second feature in the description that follows can include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and can also include embodiments in which additional features can be formed between the first and second features,such that the first and second features cannot be in direct contact.As used herein, the formation of a first feature ona second feature means the first feature is formed in direct contact with the second feature.In addition, the present disclosure can repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples.This repetition does not in itself dictate a relationship between the embodiments and/or configurations discussed herein. \n\n[0010]Spatiallyrelativeterms, such as“beneath,” “below,”“lower,”“above,”“upper,”and the like,can be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures.The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.The apparatus can be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations） and the spatially relative descriptors used herein can likewise be interpreted accordingly. \n\n[0011] It is noted that references in the specification to “one embodiment,”“an embodiment,”“an example embodiment,”“exemplary,”etc.,indicate that the embodiment described can include a particular feature,structure,or characteristic,but every embodiment can not necessarily include the particular feature,structure,or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment.Further, when a particular feature,structure or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it would be within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature,structure or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described. \n\n[0012]It is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation, such that the terminology or phraseology of the present specification is to be interpreted by those skilled in relevant art(s) in light of the teachings herein. \n\n[0013]In some embodiments,the terms“about'and“substantially\"can indicate a value of a given quantity that varies within $5 \\%$ of the value (e.g., $\\pm 1 \\%$ $\\pm 2 \\%$ $\\pm 3 \\%$ $\\pm 4 \\%$ $\\pm 5 \\%$ of the value). These values are merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.The terms“about’and “substantially”can refer to a percentage of the values as interpreted by those skilled in relevant art(s) in light of the teachings herein. \n\n[0014] The discussion of elements in FIGS.1A-1C, 3A-3B,4A-4B, 5A-5C,6A-6C,7A-7D,8A-8C, 9A-9C, 10A-10C,11A-11C,and 12A-12C with the same annotations applies to each other,unless mentioned otherwise. \n\n[0015]In semiconductor feld,a two-dimensional (2D) channel can have two dimensions outside the nanoscale and one dimension with only single-or few-layer atoms.The dimensions of the 2D channel make it differ from 3D channels.2D channel field effect transistors (FETs） are advantageous with better short channel effects (SCEs） but lack good contact with source/drain (S/D） regions (also referred to as“S/D contacts”when S/D regions include metallic material). In a sub-nanometer 2D channel,the contact area between the 2D channel and the S/D regions is very low. There is a high van der Waals gap between the top and bottom surfaces of the 2D channel. There is also a high Schottky barrier height (SBH) between the S/D regions and the 2D channel.All these factors give rise to a high contact resistance in the 2D channel FETs. \n\n[0016]The present disclosure provides example 2D channel FETs with low contact resistance between S/D rgions and 2D channels,and a method for forming such FETs using a channel last process.The channel last process means the channel is formed after the S/D regions are formed.In some embodiments,a gate opening is formed through a transition metal layer, e.g., titanium (Ti), tungsten (W),or molybdenum (Mo), leaving a thin metal layer at the bottom of the gate opening. The thin metal layer is treated with a chalcogen material, e.g., sulfur(S), selenium (Se), or tellurium (Te), to form a transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) materialbased 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate a high mobility channel in the center of the 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate lightly doped drains (LDDs） under S/D regions.The chalcogen treatment can further generate a gradient distribution of the TMC material at the two ends of the 2D channel.The gradient distribution can realize a semiconductor-semimetal-metal work function (WF) transition from the 2D channel to the S/D regions.The transition can reduce SBH,i.e., SBH tuning,between the 2D channel and the S/D regions to result in low contact resistance.The diffusion of chalcogen atoms into the thin metal layer can also reduce the van der Waals gap between the top and bottom surfaces of the 2D channel,and further reduce the contact resistance. \n\n[0017]In some embodiments,the gate opening is formed with a two-step etching process,leaving a staple-shaped 2D channel. The staple-shaped 2D channel can increase the contact area between the 2D channel and the S/D regions, thus reducing the contact resistance.By using different etching step combinations,the 2D channel can be other shapes, e.g., semicircular, trapezoid, U-shaped, etc. \n\n[0018]In some embodiments,the S/D regions can have two layers of metal. The 2D channel can have a gradient contact with the first metal layer resulting in low contact resistance.The metal-metal contact between the first metal layer and the second metal layer does not add to the contact resistance.Using two layers of metal can increase the flexibility in selecting S/D region metal because there may be a limitation on the type of metal that can be treated with chalcogen to form the 2D channel. \n\n[0019] According to some embodiments,FIGS.1A,1B, and 1C illustrate different isometric views of a 2D channel FET100 with low contact resistance.2D channel FET100 can include a substrate 102,a dielectric layer 104,S/D regions 106A-106B,spacers 110 or 126,a gate structure 130,a 2D channel 108,122,or 124,an interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer 140,and contact structures 142A,142B,and 144.ILD layer 140 can include a dielectric material, such as silicon oxide $\\mathrm { ( S i O _ { x } ) }$ .

Spacers 110 has a greater height than spacers 126 by about $1 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ to about $6 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ ，such that the staple-shaped 2D channel 124 can be formed under spacers 126. \n\n[0024]Referring to FIGS.1A-1C,in some embodiments, gate structure 130 can be a multi-layered structure. By way of example and not limitation, gate structure 130 can include a gate dielectric layer 112,a work function metal (WFM) layer114,and a filler metal layer116.Gate structure 130 can further include an interfacial oxide (IO) layer (not shown in FIGS.1A-1C).

The aspect ratio of gate structure 130 can be between about 4:1 and about 8:1.In some embodiments, the sidewalls of gate structure 130 can have a positive slope. However, this is not limiting, because gate structure 130 can be designed to have substantially vertical sidewalls (e.g., between about $8 6 ^ { \\circ }$ and about $9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ )，orsidewalls with a negative slope.The corner between the sidewalls and the bottom of gate structure 130 is shown to be straight, but in some embodiments, the corner can be rounded. \n\n[0025]Referring to FIGS.1A-1C,in some embodiments, 2D channels 108,122,and 124 can include a TMC material, such as a sulfide of any of the transition metals of the periodic table,a selenide of any of the transition metals of the periodic table,a telluride of any of the transition metals of the periodic table,an oxide of any of the transition metals of the periodic table,and a combination thereof.In some embodiments,the TMC material can include tungsten sulfide $\\mathrm { ( W S } _ { 2 } )$ ， tungsten selenide $( \\mathrm { W S e } _ { 2 } )$ ，tungsten telluride $( \\mathrm { W T e } _ { 2 } )$ ,molybdenum sulfide $\\mathrm { ( M o S } _ { 2 } ,$ ,molybdenum selenide $( \\mathrm { M o S e } _ { 2 } )$ ，molybdenum telluride $\\left( \\mathrm { M o T e } _ { 2 } \\right)$ ， $\\mathrm { T i S } _ { 2 }$ ，titanium selenide $( \\mathrm { T i S e } _ { 2 } )$ , titanium telluride $\\mathrm { ( T i T e } _ { 2 } )$ , zirconium sulfide $\\mathrm { ( } \\mathrm { Z r S } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { ) }$ , zirconium selenide $\\left( \\mathrm { Z r S e } _ { 2 } \\right)$ , zirconium telluride $\\left( \\mathrm { Z r T e } _ { 2 } \\right)$ , tantalum sulfide $\\mathrm { ( T a S } _ { 2 } )$ , tantalum selenide $( \\mathrm { T a S e } _ { 2 } )$ tantalum telluride $\\mathrm { ( T a T e } _ { 2 } )$ ，nickel sulfide $\\mathrm { ( N i S } _ { 2 } )$ ，nickel selenide $\\displaystyle ( \\mathrm { N i S e } _ { 2 } )$ ，nickel telluride $\\mathrm { ( N i T e } _ { 2 } )$ ，cobalt sulfide $\\mathrm { ( C o S } _ { 2 } )$ ， cobalt selenide $\\left( \\mathrm { C o S e } _ { 2 } \\right)$ ，cobalt telluride $\\left( \\mathrm { C o T e } _ { 2 } \\right)$ niobium sulfide $\\mathrm { ( N b S } _ { 2 } )$ , niobium selenide $\\left( \\mathrm { N b } { \\mathrm { S e } _ { 2 } } \\right)$ , niobium telluride $\\displaystyle ( \\mathrm { N b } \\mathrm { T e } _ { 2 } )$ , hafnium sulfide $\\mathrm { ( H f S } _ { 2 } )$ , hafnium selenide $\\mathrm { ( H f S e } _ { 2 } )$ ，hafnium telluride $\\mathrm { ( H f T e } _ { 2 } ,$ ，anda combination thereof. \n\n[0026]Referring to FIGS.1A-1C, in some embodiments, 2D channels 108,122,and 124 can have a composition of $\\mathrm { M } _ { x } \\mathrm { S } _ { y }$ $\\mathrm { M } _ { x } \\mathrm { S e } _ { y }$ ,or $\\mathrm { M } _ { x } \\mathrm { T e } _ { y }$ , where M is a metal including, e.g., W,Mo,Ni, Bi, Sc,or Ti.In some embodiments,X can be about 1.0.In some embodiments,in the center high mobility channel region of 2D channels 108,122,and 124,y value can be between about 1.9 and about 2.1.According to some embodiments,Figs.1D and1E are concentration profiles of chalcogen atoms in 2D channels 108,122,and 124.The concentration of the chalcogen atoms can vary from the center of 2D channels108,122,and 124,to the edges of 2D channels 108,122,and 124.At the edges of 2D channels 108,122,and 124, the atomic concentration can drop from about 1.9 to about 0,e.g.,linearly as shown in FIG.1D or exponentially as shown in FIG.1E.These examples are not meant to be limiting.In some embodiments,the atomic concentration drop can be a linear decreasing,an exponential decreasing,or other functional decreasing of the atomic concentration. There can be variations of atomic concentration in the center high mobility channel regions of 2D channels 108,122,and 124. The drop in atomic concentration can start from closer or farther than what is shown in Figs.1D and 1E.In some embodiments,there can be no substantial difference in atomic concentrations between center region and edge regions. \n\n[0027]Referring to FIGS.1A-1C, in some embodiments, the atomic concentration drop can start from below spacers 110 or 126 to the ends of 2D channels 108,122,or 124.In some embodiments,the atomic concentration drop can be from the centerline of the bottom of gate structure 130 to the ends of the bottom of gate structure 130.In some embodiments,the concentration profile of chalcogen atoms in the 2D channel can be uniform.In the Z direction, the chalcogen atoms can have a concentration profile that is decreasing linearly or exponentially from the top surface of 2D channels 108,122,and 124 to the bottom surface of 2D channels 108,122,and 124.In some embodiments,the vertical concentration profile can be substantially similar to an ion implantation dopant concentration profile. In some embodiments,2D channels 108,122,and 124 can be thin that there is no discernible difference in the concentration profile in the Z direction. \n\n[0028]In the XY plane (not shown in FIGS.1A-1C), there can be localized confinement of 2D channels 108,122,and 124 at the bottom of gate structure 130.The localized confinement can include a linear distribution.The localized confinement can include a geometric distribution, such as a rectangular, diamond,circular, etc.shape.2D channels 108, 122,and 124 can have a geometric shape,such as a rectangular, diamond, circular,etc.shape based on a photolithography pattern.In the XZ plane,the concentration profile of chalcogen atoms can be linear,or geometric,such asrectangular, trapezoidal, diamond,elliptical, semi-circular, etc.At the two ends of 2D channels108,122,and 124, e.g.,below spacers 110 or 126,the concentration profile of chalcogen atoms can have an abrupt cutoff,or a geometric cutoff as the chalcogen atoms diffuses into the metal. The geometric shape can have a radiating,diamond, elliptical, semi-circular, etc.pattern. \n\n[0029]Referring to FIGS.1A-1B, in some embodiments, length L and $\\mathrm { L } ^ { \\prime }$ of 2D channels 108 and 122 can be substantially the same as the gate length of gate structure 130, e.g., between about $5 \\mathrm { n m }$ and about $1 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ .Referring to FIG.1A,in some embodiments,height H of 2D channel 108 can be between about $0 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { { \\ n m } }$ and about $2 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { { \\ n m } }$ Referring to FIG.1B,in some embodiments,height H1 of 2D channel 122 can be between about $0 . 7 \\mathrm { n m }$ and about 2.8 nm.The ratio H1:H2 between height H1 of 2D channel122 and height H2 of S/D regions 118A-118B can be between about O.007 and about 0.6.Referring to FIG.1C,in some embodiments,length L1 of 2D channel 124 can be substantially the same as the gate length of gate structure 130, e.g., between about $5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ and about $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ .Length L2 of 2D channel 124 can be longer than length L1 of 2D channel 124 by about 1 nm to about $2 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ .Height H3 of 2D channel 124 can be between about $0 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ and about $2 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ .The ratio H3:H4 between height H3 of 2D channel 124 and height H4 of 2D channel124 can be between about 1.25 and about 2.0. In some embodiments,the corners of 2D channel 124 can be substantially rounded instead of being straight. These dimension ranges and ratios of 2D channels 108,122,and 124 provide an optimal contact area with low contact resistance between S/D regions 106A-106B and 2D channels 108,122,and124,and between S/D regions118A-118B and 2D channels 108,122,and 124 without compromising device size and manufacturing cost. \n\n[0030] Though 2D channel FET 100 with low contact resistance are described with metal S/D regions in reference to FIGS.1A-1C, S/D regions can include a metal oxide or a metal nitride.2D channels 108,122,and 124 can also be used in planar, finFET,gate-all-around(GAA） FETs,or nanosheet (NS) devices. \n\n[0031] According to some embodiments,FIG.2 is a flow chart describing methods for fabricating 2D channel FET 100 with different isometric views,as shown in FIGS. 1A-1C.For illustrative purposes, the operations illustrated in FIG.2 will be described with reference to the example fabrication process for fabricating 2D channel FET 100 (with different isometric views,as shown in FIGS.1A-1C) as illustrated in FIGS.3A-3B，4A-4B,5A-5C,6A-6C, 7A-7D,8A-8C, 9A-9C,10A-10C,11A-11C,and12A-12C. FIGS.3A-12A are cross-sectional views of 2D channel FET 100 along line A-A at various stages of fabricating 2D channel FET100 with the isometric view shown in FIG.1A, according to some embodiments.FIGS.3B-12B are crosssectional views of 2D channel FET 100 along line B-B at various stages of fabricating 2D channel FET100 with the isometric view shown in FIG.1B,according to some embodiments.FIGS.3A-4A, 5C-6C,7C-7D,and 8C-12C are cross-sectional views of 2D channel FET100 along line C-C at various stages of fabricating 2D channel FET 100 with the isometric view shown in FIG.1C,according to some embodiments.Additional fabrication operations can be performed between the various operations of method 200 and can be omitted for simplicity.These additional fabrication operations are within the spirit and the scope of this disclosure.Moreover, not all operations may be required to perform the disclosure provided herein.Additionally,some of the operations can be performed simultaneously, or in a different order than the ones shown in FIG.2.It should be noted that method 20o may not produce a complete 2D channel FET 100.Accordingly,it is understood that additional processes can be provided before, during, and after method 200,and that some other processes may only be briefly described herein.Elements in FIGS.3A-3B,4A-4B, 5A-5C, 6A-6C,7A-7D,8A-8C,9A-9C,10A-10C,11A-11C, and 12A-12C with the same annotations as elements in FIGS.1A-1C are described above. \n\n[0032] Referring to FIG.2,in operation 202,one or more metal layers are deposited on a dielectric layer disposed on a substrate.For example,as shown in FIG.3A,one metal layer106 is deposited on dielectric layer 104 disposed on substrate 102.For example,as shown in FIG.3B,two metal layers 118 and 120 are deposited on dielectric layer 104 disposed on substrate 102.Dielectric layer 104 can be deposited on substrate 102 by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), flowable CVD,or plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Other fabrication techniques for dielectric layer 104 are possible.By way of example and not limitation，dielectric layer 104 can be initially blanket deposited over substrate 102,and subsequently planarized using a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process so that the top surface of dielectric layer 104 is substantially planar. Metal layer106,118,and 120 can be deposited on dielectric layer i04 by sputtering,physical vapor deposition (PVD),CVD, PECVD,or metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Other fabrication techniques for metal layer 106,118,and 120 are possible.Metal layer 106, 118,and 120 form S/D regions 106A-106B,118A-118B,and 120A-12oB in subsequent processing.Two different metal layers 118 and 120 can increase flexibility of S/D regions because there may be a limitation on what metal can be used in forming a TMC material. \n\n[0033]Referring to FIG.2, in operation 204,a hard mask layer is deposited on the one or more metal layers.If there are more than one metal layer, the hard mask layer is deposited on the top metal layer.For example,as shown in FIGS.4A-4B, in some embodiments,hard mask layers 402 are deposited on metal layers 106 and 120.Hard mask layer 402 can include a metal oxide $( \\mathrm { M O } _ { x } )$ , a metal nitride $( \\mathrm { M N } _ { x } )$ a metal carbide $( \\mathrm { M C } _ { x } )$ ,a metalaluminate $( \\mathrm { M A l } _ { x } \\mathrm { O } _ { y } )$ ,a combination of metal oxides $( \\mathrm { M O } _ { x } / \\mathrm { M } 2 \\mathrm { O } _ { x } )$ ，ametal-silicate $\\mathrm { ( M S i O _ { x } ) }$ ，or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the metal in the above-mentioned materials is a transition metal, e.g.,hafnium (Hf), Zr, Ti, or Al, a rare earth metal, e.g.,yttrium (Y),ytterbium (Yb),or erbium (Er),or combinations thereof.By way of example and not limitation, hard mask layer 402 can include zirconium oxide $( \\mathrm { Z r O } _ { x } )$ .In some embodiments,hard mask layer 402 can include zirconium-aluminum oxide(ZrAlO） with an Al concentration between about 10 atomic percent (\"at. $\\% ^ { 9 \\prime }$ and about 25 at. $\\%$ .In some embodiments,hard mask layer 402 can include alternating layers of the aforementioned $Z \\mathrm { r O } _ { x }$ and $\\mathrm { Z r A l O }$ layers.In some embodiments,hard mask layer 402 can be deposited by thermal or plasma atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods.Alternative deposition methods, e.g., CVD, can be used as long as these alternative deposition methods offer sufficient control over the film thickness and particle generation during the deposition process.In some embodiments,hard mask layer 402 can be resistive to chemical and physical processes,and can protect top surfaces of S/D regions 106A-106B and 120A-120B from subsequent chalcogen treatment.By way of example and not limitation, hard mask layer 402 can be significantly thinner than metal layers 106,118,and 120. \n\n[0034] Referring to FIG.2,in operation 206,a gate opening is formed through the one or more metal layers and the hard mask layer. For example,as shown in FIGS.5A, in some embodiments,gate opening 506 is formed through metal layer106 and hard mask layer 402.For example,as shown in FIGS.5B,in some embodiments,gate opening 506 is formed through metal layers 118 and 120,and hard mask layer 402.For example,as shown in FIGS.5C,in some embodiments,gate opening 516 is formed through metal layer 106 and hard mask layer 402. Gate opening 516 can be shallower than gate opening 506 such that a second etch can etch back metal layer 106 in gate opening 516. \n\n[0035]Gate openings 506 and 516 can_be formed by patterned photoresist (not shown in FIGS.5A-5C). Photoresist layer can be patterned so that patterned photoresist structures are formed over hard mask layer 402.Patterning of the photoresist layer can be accomplished by exposing the photoresist layer to UV or EUV light through a reticle (e.g., a photomask） and subsequently removing_unexposed (or exposed portions) of the photoresist layer. The pitch (e.g., spacing) of the patterned photoresist structures can vary depending on the pattern design. Therefore,high and low density areas of the patterned photoresist structures (e.g., patterned photoresist structures with different pitch or spacing) can be formed over different areas of hard mask layer 402. Hard mask layer 402 can be protected from the etching chemistries because the photoresist layer functions as an etch mask. \n\n[0036]A dry etch process can remove hard mask layer 402，and metal layers 106,118,and 120 between the patterned photoresist structures to form gate openings 506 and 516.In other words,the patterned photoresist structures can be used as an etch mask to define the geometrical aspects of gate openings 506 and 516.For example,the width and the pitch of the patterned photoresist structures can be used to further define the width and the pitch of the resulting gate openings 506 and 516.The sidewall slope (or sidewall angle) of gate openings 506 and 516 can be tuned by the dry etch process conditions.Therefore, the dry etch process conditions can be adjusted to achieve the desired slope for the sidewalls of gate openings 506 and 516.In some embodiments,the dry etch process can include several etch sub-steps with a different etch chemistry for each sub-step. After gate openings 506 and 516 is formed, the patterned photoresist structures can be removed with a wet clean process (e.g.,wet strip). \n\n[0037]The dry etch process_ (e.g.，reactive ion etching process) can use a gas mixture having fluorocarbon $\\mathrm { ( C _ { \\it { x } } F _ { \\it { y } } ) }$ nitrogen $( \\Nu _ { 2 } )$ ,and argon (Ar). The gas mixture can have about $1 0 \\%$ to about $7 0 \\% \\mathrm { C } _ { x } \\mathrm { F } _ { y }$ .Gate openings 506 and 516 can be formed by a wet etch process,additionally and/or alternatively. The wet etch process can include a diluted solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF) with a buffer,such as ammonium fluoride $\\mathrm { ( N H } _ { 4 } \\mathrm { F ) }$ ,diluted HF (HF/H2O),phosphoric acid $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { P O } _ { 4 } )$ ，sulfuric acid with deionized water $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } / \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } )$ ， or any combinations thereof. The etching process can be a selective etch or a timed etch such that a thin metal layer at the bottom of gate openings 506 and 516 can be formed. \n\n[0038]Referring to FIG.2,in operation 208,a spacer material layer is deposited in the gate opening.For example, as shown in FIGS.6A-6C, in some embodiments,spacer material layers 602 are disposed in gate openings 506 and 516.Spacer material layer 602 can be deposited with a PECVD process. Other applicable deposition processes can also be used. \n\n[0039]Referring to FIG.2,in operation 210,portions of the spacer material layer outside the gate opening and on the bottom of the gate opening are removed. For example,as shown in FIGS.7A-7C, in some embodiments,portions of spacer material layers 602 on top of hard mask layers 402 and at the bottom of gate openings 506 and 516 are removed, forming spacers 110 and 126,on the sidewalls of gate openings 506 and 516.Portions of spacer material layers 602 on top of hard mask layers 402 and on the bottom of gate openings 506 and 516 can be removed by a selective dry etch. The selective dry etch can be directional,and can etch spacer material layer 602 in the vertical direction along a Z-axis significantly more than in the horizontal direction along an X-axis.In some embodiments,the etching process is anisotropic—e.g.,has a higher etching rate in the vertical direction (e.g., Z-axis） than in a lateral direction (e.g., X-axis). The dry etch process can be reactive ion etching process and can use a gas mixture having fluorocarbon $\\mathrm { ( C _ { \\it { X } } F _ { \\it { y } } ) }$ ， $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ ，and Ar. In some embodiments,the etching process can be a combination of chemical and physical etching. In some embodiments,the etching process can include multiple etching operations with different etching chemistries.The etchant(s) can be selected to have low selectivity towards hard mask layers 402 and metal layers 106 and 118.In some embodiments,the etching chemistry can be less selective towards hard mask layers 402 and metal layers106 and118,and highly selective towards the material in spacer material layers 602.The selectivity ratio between spacer material layer 6o2 and hard mask layer 402 or between spacer material layers 602 and metal layers 106 and 118 can be between about 2 and about 10.By way of example and not limitation, the etching selectivity ratio between spacer material layer 602 and hard mask layer 402 can be about 3:1 and the etching selectivity ratio between spacer material layers 602 and metal layers i06 and 118 can be about 10:1. \n\n[0040]Referring to FIG.2,in operation 212,optionally portions of the one or more metal layers at the bottom of the gate opening are removed.For example,as shown in FIG. 7D，in some embodiments,metal layer 106 is further removed with a second etch.The second etch can use a process substantially similar as the etch process used in forming gate openings 506 and 516.The second etch can be directional, selective,and/or timed. The two-step etching can form the thin metal layer at the bottom of gate opening 516 in a particular shape,e.g.， staple-shaped.Additional etching steps can be used to form the thin metal layer in different shapes, e.g., semicircular, trapezoid, U-shaped, etc. Each etching step can use a same or a different etching technique,e.g.,dry etch,wet etch, timed etch,directional etch, or selective etch. \n\n[0041]Referring to FIG.2,in operation 214,a 2D channel is formed at the bottom of the gate opening.For example, as described with reference to FIGS.7A-7B, 7D,and 8A-8C, 2D channels 108,122,and 124 are formed at the bottom of gate openings 506 and 516.As shown in FIGS.7A,7B,and 7D,in some embodiments,structures 700 are treated with chalcogen gas 704. Chalcogen gas 704 can include S-or Se-based gas, S or Se powder/gas, hydrogen sulfide $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S ) }$ or hydrogen selenide $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S e ) }$ ，hydrogen disulfide $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { ) }$ or hydrogen diselenide $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S e } _ { 2 } )$ ,dithienodisilacyclohexadiene (DTDS),di-tert-butyl sulfide (DTBS),diethyl sulfide (DES), etc. Chalcogen gas 704 can include hydrogen (H), chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F),etc.The treatment with chalcogen gas 704 (\"chalcogen treatment\") can be a CVD,a PECVD,or an ALD process with a pulse purge. The chalcogen treatment can be a CVD process with a continuous gas supply. The chalcogen treatment can be plasma-enhanced, e.g., inductively coupled plasma (ICP),capacitively coupled plasma (CCP)，microwave,electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma,etc.The power of the plasma enhancement can be between about $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { ~ W ~ }$ and about $5 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { W } .$ The chalcogen treatment temperature can be between about $3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } ~ \\mathrm { C }$ and about $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } ~ \\mathrm { C }$ 、with plasma enhancement or between about $5 0 0 ^ { \\circ } ~ \\mathrm { C }$ .and about $1 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ 、without plasma enhancement. The flow rate of the chalcogen gas can be between about 0.5 sccm and about 1O sccm. The flow rate of the Ar or ${ \\Nu } _ { 2 }$ protective gas can be between about 5 sccm and about 1000 sccm.The flow rate of the hydrogen $\\left( \\operatorname { H } _ { 2 } \\right)$ plasma gas can be between about O sccm and about 100 sccm.The pressure of the processing chamber can be between about 1 Torr and about 1O Torr. The chalcogen treatment can last for a predetermined period of time based on the growth rate and the desired thickness of the 2D channel to be formed. Chalcogen gas 704 can be applied directionally. Hard mask layers 402 can protect the top surfaces of metal layer 106 and 120 from being treated with chalcogen gas 704. Spacers 110 and 126 can protect the sidewalls of metal layers 106 and 120 from being treated with chalcogen gas 704. \n\n[0042]Referring to FIGS.8A-8C,the chalcogen treatment can form a monolayer or multiple layers of chalcogen atoms on top of the thin metal layers in gate openings 506 and 516 which is the same material as metal layers 106 and 118.The monolayer or multiple layers of chalcogen atoms can diffuse within the thin metal layers and form 2D channels 108,122, and 124 including TMC materials.The chalcogen treatment can generate a high mobility channel in the center of 2D channels 108,122,and 124. The chalcogen treatment can generate LDDs under S/D regions 106A-106B and 118A118B.The chalcogen treatment can further generate a gradient distribution of the TMC material at the two ends of the 2D channel,e.g.,under spacers 110 or 126.The gradient distribution can realize a semiconductor-semimetal-metal WF transition from 2D channels 108,122,and 124 to S/D regions 106A-106B and 118A-118B.The transition can reduce SBH, i.e., SBH tuning,between 2D channel 108 and S/D regions 106A-106B,between 2D channel 124 and S/D regions 106A-106B,and between 2D channel 122 and S/D regions 118A-118B to result in low contact resistance. The diffusion of chalcogen atoms into the thin metal layer can also create a continuous medium between the top and bottom surfaces of 2D channels 108,122,and 124.The continuity can reduce the van der Waals gap between the top and bottom surfaces of 2D channels 108,122,and 124,and further reduce the contact resistance. \n\n[0043]Referring to FIG.8B,2D channel 122 can have a gradient contact with S/D regions 118A-118B resulting in low contact resistance.The metal-metal contact between S/D regions 118A-118B and 120A-120B does not substantially add to the contact resistance or substantially affect the overall contact resistance.Using two layers of metal can increase the flexibility in selecting S/D regions because there may be a limitation on the type of metal that can be treated with chalcogen atoms to form a 2D channel.Another advantage of using two layers of metal can be metal layer 118 may have a better adhesion to dielectric layer 104 than metal layer 120. \n\n[0044] Referring to FIG.8C,2D channel 124 can be staple-shaped or in other shapes.The differently shaped 2D channel 124 can increase the contact area between 2D channel 124 and S/D regions 106A-106B,thus reducing the contact resistance. \n\n[0045] Referring to FIG.2,in operation 216,a gate structure is formed in the gate opening.For example, as described with reference to FIGS.9A-i1C,gate structure 130 is formed.As shown in FIGS.9A-9C,10A-10C,and 11A-11C, in some embodiments,gate dielectric layers 902, WFMlayers 1002,and filler metal layers 1102 are deposited in gate openings 506 and 516 on top of 2D channels 108, 122,and 124.Referring to FIGS.9A-9C,gate dielectric layers 902 are formed on top of hard mask layers 402, on top of 2D channels 108,122,and 124,and on sidewalls of spacers 110 and 126.Any suitable processes can be used to form gate dielectric layers 9o2.For example, gate dielectric layers 902 can be deposited using aPECVD,a CVD,a PVD, or an ALD process.Gate dielectric layers 902 can maintain the carrier mobility in 2D channel 108,122,and 124. \n\n[0046]Referring to FIGS.10A-10C,WFMlayers 1002 are formed on top of gate dielectric layers 902.A WF is associated with the material composition of WFM layers 1002,and thus,the material of WFM layers 1002 can be chosen to tune its WF so that a desired threshold voltage $\\mathrm { V } _ { t }$ is achieved.WFM layers 1002 can be formed bya PECVD, a CVD, a PVD, an ALD, or an MOCVD process, sputtering, other suitable deposition methods,or any combination thereof. \n\n[0047]Referring to FIGS.11A-11C,filler metal layers 1102 are formed on top of WFM layers 1002.Filler metal layers 11o2 fill up the rest of space in gate openings 506 and 516.Filler metal layers 1102 can be formed by a PECVD, a \n\nCVD, a PVD, an ALD, or an MOCVD process, sputtering, other suitable deposition methods,or any combination thereof. \n\n[0048]In some embodiments,filler metal layers 1102, WFM layers 1002,gate dielectric layers 902,spacers 110 and 126,and hard mask layers 402 are polished such that the above-described layers are substantially co-planar with metal layers 106 and 120.In some embodiments,after the above-described layers are formed,a planarization process, e.g.,CMP, is used to remove the extra thickness of these layers over metal layers 106 and 120.In various embodiments,other planarization/etching process can also be used to reduce the above-described layers to be substantially coplanar. \n\n[0049]Referring to FIG.2,in operation 218,contact structures are formed.For example,as described with reference to FIGS.12A-12C,gate contact structure 144 and S/D contact structures 142A and142B are formed.As shown in FIGS.12A-12C,in some embodiments,ILD layer 140 can be deposited by a CVD process on gate structure 130, spacers 110,and S/D regions 106A-106B and 120A-120B. Contact openings can be formed in ILD layer 140 by a photolithographic patterning process and an etching process. The etching process can be a dry etching process, a wet etching process,or combinations thereof. Sidewalls of the contact openings can be substantially vertical or slanted.The locations, shapes, and sizes of the contact openings are for illustrative purposes only.A conductive metal can be deposited in the contact openings by a PECVD,a CVD,a PVD, an ALD, or an MOCVD process, sputtering, other suitable deposition methods,or any combination thereof.A planarization process,such as CMP,can be used to remove the extra thickness of the conductive metal to form contact structures 142A,142B,and 144.After contact structures 142A,142B,and 144 are formed,2D channel FET100 as shown in FIGS.1A-1C are formed. \n\n[0050]The present disclosure is directed to a 2D channel FET (e.g.,2D channel FET100) with low contact resistance and a method (e.g., method 2oo) for forming such a structure using a channel last process. The channel last process means the channel is formed after the S/D regions are formed.In some embodiments, a gate opening (e.g., gate opening 506 or 516) is formed through a metal layer, e.g.,Ti,W,or Mo, leaving a thin metal layer at the bottom of the gate opening. The thin metal layer is treated with a chalcogen material, e.g., S,Se,or Te,to form a 2D channel (e.g.,2D channel 108, 122,or 124).A TMC material can be formed in the 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate a high mobility channel in the center of the 2D channel. The chalcogen treatment can generate LDDs under the S/D regions (e.g., S/D regions 106A-106B and 118A-118B). The chalcogen treatment can further generate a gradient distribution of the TMC material at the two ends of the 2D channel. The gradient distribution can realize a semiconductor-semimetal-metal WF transition from the 2D channel to the S/D regions. The transition can reduce SBH, i.e., SBH tuning, between the 2D channel and the S/D regions to result in low contact resistance.The diffusion of chalcogen atoms into the thin metal layer can also reduce the van der Waals gap between the top and bottom surfaces of the 2D channel,and further reduce the contact resistance. \n\n[0051] In some embodiments,the gate opening is formed with a two-step etching process, leaving a staple-shaped 2D channel. The staple-shaped 2D channel can increase the contact area between the 2D channel and the S/D regions, thus reducing the contact resistance.By using different etching step combinations,the 2D channel can be other shapes, e.g.,semicircular, trapezoid, U-shaped, etc. \n\n[0052]In some embodiments,two layers of metal can be used for the S/D regions.The 2D channel can have a gradient contact with the first metal layer resulting in low contact resistance.The metal-metal contact between the first metal layer and the second metal layer does not add to the contact resistance.Using two layers of metal can increase the flexibility in selecting S/D contact metal because there may be a limitation on the type of metal that can be treated with chalcogen to form the 2D channel. \n\n[0053]In some embodiments,a method includes depositing a dielectric layer on a semiconductor substrate,depositing a metal layer on the dielectric layer, and depositing a hard mask layer on the metal layer.The method further includes forming a gate opening by removing a portion of the hard mask layer and a portion of the metal layer. The method further includes depositing a spacer material layer on sidewalls of the gate opening and forming a channel, the channel including a TMC layer,at a bottom of the gate opening. The method further includes forming a gate structure on the channel and in the gate opening and removing the hard mask layer. \n\n[0054]In some embodiments,a method includes depositing a first metal layer on a dielectric layer disposed on a substrate,depositing a second metal layer on the first metal layer,and forming a gate opening by removing a portion of the first metal layer and a portion of the second metal layer. The method further includes depositing a spacer on sidewalls of the gate opening and forming a channel, the channel including a TMC layer,at a bottom of the gate opening and in the first metal layer. The method further includes forming a gate structure on the channel and in the gate opening, the gate structure including a gate dielectric layer, a WFM layer, and a filler metal layer. \n\n[0055]In some embodiments,a structure includes a dielectric layer disposed on a substrate,S/D regions includinga metallic material disposed on the dielectric layer,and a gate structure disposed between the S/D regions,where the gate structure includes a gate dielectric layer, a WFMlayer, and a filler metal layer. The structure further includes a spacer interposed between each of the S/D regions and the gate structure and a channel including a TMC layer that connects the S/D regions and is in contact with the dielectric layer. \n\n[0056]It is to be appreciated that the Detailed Description section,and not the Abstract of the Disclosure section,is intended to be used to interpret the claims.The Abstract of the Disclosure section can set forth one or more but not all possible embodiments of the present disclosure as contemplated by the inventor(s),and thus,are not intended to limit the subjoined claims in any way. \n\n[0057]The foregoing disclosure outlines features of several embodiments so that those skilled in the art can better understand the aspects of the present disclosure.Those skilled in the art will appreciate that they can readily use the present disclosure as a basis for designing or modifying other processes and structures for carrying out the same purposes and/or achieving the same advantages of the embodiments introduced herein.Those skilled in the art will also realize that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure,and that they can make various changes,substitutions,and alterations herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. \n\nWhat is claimed is: \n\n1.A semiconductor device, comprising:   \na substrate;
